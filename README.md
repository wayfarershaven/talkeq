## Enabling Players to talk from Discord to EQ
* (Admin-level accounts on Discord can only do the following steps.)
* Inside discord go to Server Settings.
* Go to Roles.
* Create a new role, with the name: `IGN: <username>`. The `IGN:` prefix is required for DiscordEQ to detect a player and is used to identify the player in game, For example, to identify the discord user `Xackery` as `Shin`, Create a role named `IGN: Shin`, right click the user Xackery, and assign the role to them.
* If the above user chats inside the assigned channel, their message will appear in game as `Shin says from discord, 'Their Message Here'`
